# DSCC-FP-MVP

### Scenario

You are working as a Data Scientist at Data Science Consultation Company (DSCC). 
You are responsible for talking and interacting with DSCC customers, understanding their needs, and offering data science solutions to their needs.  DSCC has several clients in various domains such as healthcare, finance, and business. It’s in the best interests of DSCC to add to their clientele and widen their revenue streams. Hence, any new client is a major success for the DSCC team. 

A major financial company named Financial Planet (FP) which is in Montreal has come forward and they want to work with the team at DSCC for their data science activities. FP offers financial consultations to clients who want to invest in the stock market.  
FP has approached DSCC to bring AI/ML to their portfolio so that they can offer AI-Backed advice to their clients. FP is competing with firms that are already doing this and therefore, time is of the essence for FP.

To ensure that the DSCC team can deliver what the FP team needs, FP has requested the data science team at DSCC to demonstrate their abilities by showcasing an MVP (minimum viable product).

The MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that you and your team are responsible for should include the following components. Of course, you are encouraged to expand on this list, but this list is the bare-minimum requirement for the MVP. The MVP should have the capability to:</br>
•	Collects data (using APIs)</br>
•	Stores it in databases or Data Sources (relational, or no relational databases, or even object storage options such as AWS S3)</br>
•	Loads the data from the database or data source</br>
•	Manipulates Data (dealing with missing values, errors in data, anomalies, etc.)</br>
•	Explore the data using data exploration techniques including visualization</br>
•	Visualizes the data</br>
•	Provides AI/ML or Statistical analysis</br>
•	Concludes the project with a report that contains the result of the analysis and all other details that you feel are needed.</br>

### Purpose

This repository serves as the SCM (Source Code Management) for our project. We will be updating the code on a continual basis until the requirements for the MVP are achieved.
